# ZygiskFrida

> [Frida](https://frida.re) is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers

> [Zygisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) part of Magisk allows you to run code in every Android application's Process.


## Introduction

[ZygiskFrida](README.md) is a zygisk module allowing you to inject frida gadget in Android applications in a
more stealthy way.

- The gadget is not embedded into the APK itself. So APK Integrity/Signature checks will still pass.
- The process is not being ptraced like it is with frida-server. Avoiding ptrace based detection.
- Control about the injection time of the gadget.
- Allows you to load multiple arbitrary libraries into the process.

This repo also provides a [Riru](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru) flavor in case you are still
using riru with an older magisk version rather than zygisk.

## How to use the module

### Quick start
- Download the latest release from the [Release Page](https://github.com/lico-n/ZygiskFrida/releases)\
  If you are using riru instead of zygisk choose the riru-release. Otherwise choose the normal version.
- Transfer the ZygiskFrida zip file to your device and install it via Magisk.
- Reboot after install
- Create the config file and adjust the package name to your target app.
  f.e.
```shell
adb shell 'su -c cp /data/local/tmp/re.zyg.fri/config.json.example /data/local/tmp/re.zyg.fri/config.json'
adb shell 'su -c sed -i s/com.example.package/your.target.application/ /data/local/tmp/re.zyg.fri/config.json'
```
- Launch your app. It will pause at startup allowing you to attach
  f.e. `frida -U -N your.target.application` or `frida -U -n Gadget`

This assumes that you don't have any other frida server running (f.e. by using MagiskFrida).
You can still run it together with frida-server but you would have to configure the gadget
to use a different port.

### Configuration

This module also supports adding a start up delay that can delay injection of the gadget to
avoid checks run at startup time, loading arbitrary libraries and child gating.

Please take a look at the [configuration guide](docs/advanced_config.md) for this.

## How to build

- Checkout the project
- Run `./gradlew :module:assembleRelease`
- The build magisk module should then be in the `out` directory.

You can also build and install the module to your device directly with `./gradlew :module:flashAndRebootZygiskRelease`

## Caveats

- For emulators this will start the gadget in native realm. This means that you will be able to hook Java but not native functions.
